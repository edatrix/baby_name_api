TODO = name app

_this app is still undergoing maintenance_

If you've ever had a kid, you know that naming him or her is no small task. Thankfully, the US Social Security Administration makes public (baby) name popularity by rank and year based off of the names on applications for social security numbers.

Unfortunately, they don't provide this information to developers in a readable API. To fill the gap, I've made this app that does exactly that.

Enjoy!
